### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Erika-Joelle Roncal-Schuyler, but you can call me Erika, EJ, or Erielle, and I bring a unique blend of expertise to the table. I am a Filipina Software Engineer with a background in Psychology, committed to making a positive social impact while valuing innovation and tradition.

As a psychology graduate turned software developer, I possess the empathetic and technical skills needed for well-rounded development. My focus is on creating impactful products that meet the highest industry standards.

Throughout my career, I have implemented mentorship programs and gained extensive experience in HR, including full-cycle recruiting and conducting interviews. This experience allows me to connect with people deeper and better understand their needs.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me with my dogs and experimenting with recipes in the kitchen. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to achieve amazing things!
