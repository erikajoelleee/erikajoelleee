### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Erika-Joelle Roncal-Schuyler, but you can call me Erika, EJ, or Erielle. I'm a passionate Filipina Software Engineer with a unique blend of expertise, including a background in Psychology. My journey from psychology graduate to software developer has equipped me with a diverse skill set that combines empathy with technical aspects, enabling me to excel in software engineering.

I'm driven by a solid commitment to creating a positive social impact through innovation and respecting tradition. My focus is on crafting software solutions that meet industry standards and resonate with users on a meaningful level.

What sets me apart is my extensive experience in HR, where I've successfully implemented mentorship programs and honed skills such as full-cycle recruiting and conducting interviews. These experiences have enriched my ability to connect with people, deeply understand their needs, and translate that understanding into user-centric software.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy quality time with my dogs and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I'm excited to connect and explore how we can collaborate to achieve remarkable outcomes.
